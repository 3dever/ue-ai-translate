1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Place all files from **script** folder to your Unreal Engine localization folder (e.g., `Content/Localization`).
3. Run the setup script:

```bat
ai-translate_install.bat
```

This will:
- Install Python (if not already installed).
- Install required packages: `openai`, `polib`, `python-dotenv`.

If Python is already installed, you can launch directly using:

```bat
ai-translate.bat
```

For Linux:

Make sure that **tkinter** is installed
```install
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```
